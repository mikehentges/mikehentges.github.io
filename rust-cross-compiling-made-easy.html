    <h2>Rust Cross Compiling Made Easy</h2>
    
    <p>Oct 17, 2022</p>

    <p>This article is the second installment of my series on building a wireless thermostat in Rust for the Raspberry Pi. You can find the <a href="https://mhentges.com/rpi-thermostat">beginning of the series here</a>. All source code for the project is <a href="https://github.com/mikehentges/thermostat-pi">located here</a>.</p>

<p>As I approached the task of building a native Rust executable for the Raspberry Pi, one of the first things I had to tackle was establishing a cross-compiling development environment. The Raspberry Pi runs a flavor of Unix, but we need to compile executables for the Pi’s ARM processor.</p>

<p>My first attempt followed the process documented in the Cross-compilation chapter of <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html">The Rustup Book</a>. I had to find the appropriate target for a Raspberry Pi Zero (my target): <code class="language-html highlighter-rouge">arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf</code>. This target will be slightly different if you want to target a Pi 3 or Pi 4 – then you can use <code class="language-html highlighter-rouge">target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf</code>. The Pi Zero runs a v6 version of the ARM processor, larger Pi’s use a v7 (or higher) version.</p>

<p>Cross-compiling sounded easy, and following the Rustup Book’s directions added cross-compiling to my environment:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code>rustup target add arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
cargo build –target= arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that doesn’t work out of the box. Even the documentation warns you: <em>“Note that rustup target add only installs the Rust standard library for a given target. There are typically other tools necessary to cross-compile, particularly a linker.”</em> Then, my application used SSL – and I also needed a way to cross-compile the openssl library for the Pi. I build under WSL2 (Ubuntu) on a Windows machine – getting this set up would take some effort.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s an easier way! The <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg#the-tools-team">Rust Embedded Devices Tools Team</a> publishes a set of Docker images that contain a complete toolchain for a large number of cross-compile targets. Even better, they created a “ cross “ tool that automates the entire process of launching a suitable Docker container, getting your code attached to the container, and running the compile process. Incremental builds are fully supported, so cross-compiling does not take much longer than native compiling.</p>

<p>To set this up, you first to install the “cross” tool:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code>cargo install cross
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, compiling any project for a new target is as simple as substituting “cross” for “cargo” in your command. I also had to pass a features flag to get the OpenSSL library built from source for the target platform:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code>cross build --release –target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --features vendored-openssl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That command will build a release executable at <code class="language-html highlighter-rouge">./target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/thermostat-pi</code> (my project is “thermostat-pi”).</p>

<p>For another part of the project, I needed to cross-compile to x86_64-unknown-linux-musl to create an AWS Lambda using Rust. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/lambda.html">AWS Rust SDK</a> documents the steps and includes the “Container approach” that uses cross:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code>cross build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can find the lambda project in the ./push_temp folder in the <a href="https://github.com/mikehentges/thermostat-pi/tree/main/push-temp">source repository</a>.</p>

<p>All these build commands are too long for me to remember. Command-line history helps a ton, but returning to the project after an extended break can mean looking up the build commands again. Instead, I recently found <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">just</a>, a lighter-weight version of make that is purpose-built as a command runner. You can create a justfile, using syntax similar to make’s Makefile, to define a set of commands. Dependencies are supported, allowing you to bundle together different commands as needed. For the ./push_temp project, its very simple justfile looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-makefile highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code><span class="nl">build</span><span class="o">:</span>
	cross build <span class="nt">--release</span> <span class="nt">--target</span> x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
	<span class="nb">cp </span>target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/push_temp bootstrap
<span class="nl">test</span><span class="o">:</span>
	curl <span class="nt">-X</span> POST <span class="nt">-F</span> <span class="s2">"record_date=2022:02:03T15:50:00"</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> <span class="s2">"thermostat_on=true"</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> <span class="s2">"temperature=55"</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> <span class="s2">"thermostat_value=60"</span> https://5zvz7wehuh.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test_lambda
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This setup allows a simple ``just build` command – which I can remember! The test target sends a sample transaction to my lambda function – again, keeping in a central place a longer command that I can reuse as needed.</p>

<p>I also created a justfile to run the cross-compile of the main project and automated the deployment of the executable to the Raspberry Pi. The justfile I created looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-makefile highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax"><code><span class="nv">TARGET_HOST</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"mhentges@shop-therm.local"</span>
<span class="nv">TARGET_PATH</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"/home/mhentges/thermostat-pi"</span>
<span class="nv">TARGET_ARCH</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf"</span>
<span class="nv">SOURCE_PATH</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"./target/"</span> + TARGET_ARCH + <span class="s2">"/release/thermostat-pi"</span>

<span class="nl">check</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="err">cargo</span> <span class="err">check</span>

<span class="nl">build</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="err">cross</span> <span class="err">build</span> <span class="err">--release</span> <span class="nv">--target</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="nt">--features</span> vendored-openssl
    <span class="nl">rsync ./configuration.yaml </span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nf">/home/mhentges/configuration.yaml</span>
    <span class="nl">rsync  </span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="c">#ssh -t  
</span>
<span class="nl">clippy</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="err">cargo</span> <span class="err">clippy</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This script relies on SSH being available between your host machine and the PI, configured with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server">public key authentication</a>.</p>

<p>Using the Cross tools is the secret sauce that makes cross-compiling for Rust easy. Whether you use Windows, macOS, Linux, or rent a dev box in the cloud, you can set up the cross-compiling environment with a few simple commands. Then, use just to provide automation to allow for easy-to-execute build and deploy steps.</p>
