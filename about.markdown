## Michael Hentges

This blog is what happens when a CTO "retires." After working for over 20 years in the contact center space, there were a set of standard technologies that we used every day. Java - J2EE - was the primary development environment for producing VoiceXML content for IVR systems. Our team got pretty good at designing and building mission-critical systems that ran under Tomcat. These were 24x7x365 environments, and most were inside our customer's premise data centers. We did a pretty good job writing complex systems that didn't break - which is no small feat.

There were other ancillary technologies that we would use. CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) systems often require Windows desktop development or browser extensions. Our team also built web applications for code-table maintenance applications and lightweight reporting.

Now that I'm not doing this professionally - and since I'm a technologist at heart - there were many other technologies to learn!

This blog is my collection of writings on the new (and some not-so-new) things I've been working on lately.
